# Overview <a name="overview" />

This is test/demo environment for
[Metal Kubed - Bare Metal Host Provisioning for Kubernetes][metal3]
The purpose of this environment is demonstrate the capabilities
of [Kubernetes Cluster API][CAPI], for Kubernetes workload cluster
life cycle management.

The demo environment consists of a single "management cluster" VM
and automation to enable arbitrary numbers of VM hosts to be created
to emulate baremetal downstream cluster hosts (by default a single
controlplane and worker host will be created)

- Refer to the [Metal3 Setup Doc](./docs/setup/metal3-setup.md) for a walkthrough of the Metal3 Demo environment setup.
- The [RKE2 Setup Doc](./docs/setup/rke2-cluster.md) is a walkthrough of the deployment of a sample RKE2 cluster on the virtual bare metal hosts.
